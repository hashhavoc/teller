# Teller

Teller is a sophisticated Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to facilitate developers' interactions with STX contracts. It streamlines the process of exploring source code and leveraging various analytics tools, thereby significantly enhancing the developer experience within the STX ecosystem. With its intuitive design, Teller ensures that integrating STX contracts into projects is both straightforward and efficient.

## Installing

Homebrew is the recommended way to install Teller:

```sh
brew install hashhavoc/tap/teller
```

## Upgrade

```sh
brew upgrade hashhavoc/tap/teller
```

## Configuration

There is a configuration file that contains various configuration values. You can find an example at `config/config.yaml.example`.

```sh
teller conf init
```

This will create a new configuration file at `~/.teller.yaml` with the default values. You can then edit this file to your liking. There is not currently a way to specify the configuration file location. Not all of the endpoints are avaliable publicly, so you may need to specify your own endpoints.

The configuration file supports:

- **API Endpoints**: Configure custom endpoints for Hiro, Alex DEX, STXTools, BOB, and Ord
- **Wallet Addresses**: Pre-configure wallet addresses for quick access
- **OpenAI Integration**: Set up API keys, models, and custom base URLs for LLM functionality

See the [LLM Assistant](#llm-assistant) section for detailed OpenAI configuration options.

```

### Configuration

Add OpenAI configuration to your `~/.teller.yaml`:

```yaml
openai:
  # Get your API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
  # You can also set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable instead
  api_key: "your-openai-api-key"
  
  # Available models: gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo, etc.
  model: "gpt-4"
  
  # Base URL for OpenAI API - useful for self-hosted or alternative LLM endpoints
  # Default: https://api.openai.com/v1
  # Examples for other providers:
  # - OpenAI-compatible local models: http://localhost:1234/v1
  # - Azure OpenAI: https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/your-deployment
  # - Anthropic Claude (via proxy): https://your-proxy/v1
  base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
```

Alternatively, set the API key via environment variable:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
teller llm chat
```
